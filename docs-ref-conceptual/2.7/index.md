# Cognitive Toolkit Python API (2.6)

[CNTK](/cognitive-toolkit), the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, is a system for describing, training,
and executing computational networks. It is also a framework for describing
arbitrary learning machines such as deep neural networks (DNNs). CNTK is an
implementation of computational networks that supports both CPU and GPU.
 
This page describes the Python API for [CNTK](/cognitive-toolkit) version vLatest.
